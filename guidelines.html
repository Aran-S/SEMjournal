                            <p> The Discussion should interpret the findings in view of the results obtained in this and in past studies on this topic. Discussion sections can include subheadings and this section may be combined with Result </p>

                                <b>Tables and Figures </b>
                                <br> All figures and tables should be cited and discussed in the article text. Tables should be kept to a minimum and be designed to be as simple as possible. Tables are to be typed double-spaced throughout, including headings and footnotes. Each table should be on a separate page, numbered consecutively in Arabic numerals and supplied with a heading and a legend. Tables should be self-explanatory without reference to the text. The details of the methods used in the experiments should preferably be described in the legend instead of in the text. The same data should not be presented in both table and graph forms or repeated in the text. Figure legends should be typed in numerical order on a separate sheet. Graphics should be prepared using applications capable of generating high resolution GIF, TIFF, JPEG or PowerPoint before pasting in the Microsoft Word manuscript file. Tables should be prepared in Microsoft Word. Use Arabic numerals to designate figures and upper case letters for their parts (Fig.1). Begin each legend with a title and include sufficient description so that the figure is understandable without reading the text of the manuscript. Information given in legends should not be repeated in the text

                            <ul>
                                <li>A full double-blind refereeing process is used that comprises of the following steps.</li>
                                <li>A preliminary review for content and form is done by the Chief Editor, and a notification of the adequacy and acceptability is communicated to the author immediately. Papers are accepted or rejected at this point. </li>
                                <li>Upon acceptance, the author is requested to pay the publication fee so that a formal acceptance letter is issued. Once the formal acceptance letter is issued, the paper is sent to 2 reviewers for review. </li>
                                <li>The reviewers’ recommendations determine the extent of changes that are required.</li>
                                <li>For papers which require changes, Internal editors will follow up to ensure that these are effected. </li>
                                <li>Author/Corresponding Author will be notified about the possible date of publication</li>
                                <li>Upon publication, the authors will be issued with links to their publication, a pdf copy of the publication and a publication certificate. </li>
                                <li>Authors requiring hardcopy print of the issue in which their paper appears can make orders and this will be processed on demand </li>
